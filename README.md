# StardewLike

A 2D platformer game built with Godot Engine. Navigate through levels, collect coins, avoid killzones, and jump on moving platforms to complete the game. The game features pixel art graphics, sound effects, and background music for an engaging gameplay experience.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download and install Godot Engine version 4.5 or later from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/)
2. Open the project by launching Godot and selecting "Import" or by double-clicking the `project.godot` file
3. Click the "Play" button in the top-right corner of the Godot editor, or press F5 to run the game

Instructions for using the software:

1. Use the **Left Arrow** or **A** key to move left
2. Use the **Right Arrow** or **D** key to move right
3. Press **Space** or **Up Arrow** to jump
4. Collect all coins scattered throughout the level
5. Avoid falling into killzones (the bottom of the level) - touching them will reset the level
6. Use moving platforms to reach higher areas and collect all coins
7. Complete the level by collecting all coins to win!

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Godot Engine 4.5 (or later) with GL Compatibility rendering method
* GDScript (included with Godot)
* Pixel art assets (fonts, sprites, sounds, and music included in the project)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Godot Engine Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/)
